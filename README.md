The Plant Disease Detection project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images of plants as healthy or diseased. Through training on a dataset containing labeled images, the model learns to accurately identify symptoms of various plant diseases. By analyzing input images, the system provides rapid and accurate diagnoses, aiding farmers in early disease detection and crop management. This project showcases the efficacy of deep learning in addressing agricultural challenges, offering a valuable tool for improving crop health and yield optimization.
